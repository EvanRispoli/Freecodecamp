      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Alan Turing life:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1912</strong> - Born in London, England</li>

        <li>
          <strong>1926</strong> - Aged 14, he was sent to Sherborne School in Dorset.
           His first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike. Turing was so 
           determined not to miss his first day of school that he cycled the 97km from 
           his home in Southampton. His teachers worried that he leaned too heavily towards 
           maths and science, at the expense of the classics. The headmaster wrote to his 
           parents: "If he is to be solely a scientific specialist, he is wasting his time 
           at a public school.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>1927</strong> - At the age of 16, Turing got to grips with Albert 
          Einstein's work and extrapolated Einstein's questioning of Newton's Laws of 
          Motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>1930</strong> - Turing's close school friend Christopher Morcom dies 
          suddenly from bovine tuberculosis. Turing renounces his religious faith and 
          becomes an atheist.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>1931</strong> -  Turing goes to study Mathematics at King's College, Cambridge.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>1935</strong> -  Turing proves the central limit theorem in his 
          dissertation and is made a fellow at King's at the age of just 22.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>1936</strong> - Turing published his paper 
          <em>On Computable Numbers and an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem</em>
          (decision problem) in which he outlines the Universal Machine, which later 
          became known as the Turing Machine. This was an idealised computing 
          device that is capable of performing any mathematical computation that 
          can be represented as an algorithm.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>1936 - 1938</strong> -  Turing spent time at Princeton in the US
           studying under Alonzo Church. There he started to study cryptology as
            well as mathematics. In 1938 he received his PhD; his dissertation
             was called Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals and introduced original 
             logic and relative computing.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>1939</strong> -   Turing proposes to his co-worker Joan Clarke, 
          a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst. Shortly after, Turing had second 
          thoughts, admitting to his fiancee that he was homosexual.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>1942</strong> -  Turing sent to the US as part of an intelligence 
          collaboration. He shared what he knew about Enigma in return for being allowed
           to inspect the speech encryption system being set up to allow conversations 
           between Churchill and Roosevelt. Turing was somewhat dismissive of US 
           cryptanalysis, believing the Americans to rely too heavily on machinery 
           instead of thought.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>1941-43:</strong> - Turing and colleagues manage to break the more 
          complicated German Naval Enigma system. This is extremely helpful for the 
          Allies during the Battle of the Atlantic as it could help them avoid the 
          fearsome German U-boats, which had been responsible for sinking more than 
          700 Allied ships with 2.3 million tons of vital cargo.
        </li>

        <li><strong>1945</strong> - At the end of World War II, Turing is awarded an 
            OBE for his services to his country
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>1949</strong> - Turing became deputy director of the Computing Laboratory
           at Manchester University, working on software for one of the earliest stored 
           program computers -- the Manchester Mark 1. He also explored the problem of 
           artificial intelligence and proposed an experiment (in his seminal paper 
           Computing Machinery and Intelligence) which became that attempted to 
           define a standard for machine intelligence, which would later become known 
           as the Turing test. The core idea was that a computer could be said to "think"
            if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a
             human being. Turing also worked with his former colleague D G Champernowne on a chess program for a computer that did not exist yet.


        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1952</strong> - Without a computer powerful enough to execute his chess
           program, Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer, taking about 
           half an hour to perform each move. The program lost to Turing's colleague Alick 
           Glennie, but won against Champernowne's wife.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1952</strong> - Turing meets a man called Arnold Murray and invites him 
          over to his house. Murray visits Turing's house on a number of occasions, staying
           the night. Murray later helps an accomplice break into Turing's house. Turing 
           reports the crime and admits having a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual 
           acts are illegal in the UK and so both were charged with gross indecency. Turing 
           is given the choice of being imprisoned or chemically castrated with oestrogen 
           hormone injections. He chooses the latter. Turing's conviction means his security
            clearance is removed which means he is barred from his cryptopgraphic consultancy
             for the British government.
        </li>
        <li><strong>08 june 1954</strong> - Turing's cleaner finds him dead. It appears that 
            Turing poisoned himself using a cyanide-laced apple..</li>
      </ul>
