                <p>Serbian-American engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) made dozens of breakthroughs in the production, transmission and application of electric power. He invented the first alternating current (AC) motor and developed AC generation and transmission technology. Though he was famous and respected, he was never able to translate his copious inventions into long-term financial success—unlike his early employer and chief rival, Thomas Edison.</p>
                <h3 id="timelineheader">Here's a list with some of his inventions:</h3>

                <ul>

                <li><p><strong id="lititle">The Tesla Coil</strong> - A Tesla coil consists of a primary coil and secondary coil,
                    each with its own capacitor to store electrical energy. The two coils and capacitors are connected by a spark gap.
                    A high-voltage source powers the system.
                    The primary coil's capacitor eventually builds up so much charge that it breaks down the air resistance in the
                    spark gap. Then, the current flows out of the capacitor down the primary coil and creates a magnetic field.
                    This field collapses quickly and generates an electric current in the secondary coil. The voltage zipping through
                    the air between the two coils creates sparks in the gap and, eventually, the charge in the secondary capacitor
                    becomes so high that it breaks free in a spectacular burst of electric current. The resulting high-frequency
                    voltage can illuminate fluorescent bulbs several feet away with no wire connection.</p>
                </li>

                <li><p><strong id="li-title">The Magnifying Transmitter</strong> - Tesla had intended the Tesla Coil to be part of a wireless
                    power system and was a mainstay of many of Tesla’s other experiments.
                    By running a wire connected to the resonator around his lab he permeated his lab with electromagnetic energy and
                    was able to light a fluorescent bulb held in his hand because the voltage drop through the air was great enough to
                    cause a sufficient current flow. Using a  magnifying transmitter, he was also reportedly able to light a field of
                    bulbs at a distance of 1 km. The magnifying transmitter was an adaptation of the Tesla coil, only instead of
                    discharging to the earth, the magnifying transmitter created standing waves of electrical energy, which could be
                    harnessed by a tuned receiving circuit. </p>
                </li>

                <li><p><strong id="li-title">The Tesla Turbine</strong> - Tesla saw the rise of the piston engine in the automobile
                    industry as a way to make a change in the world. He developed his own turbine-style engine that used combustion to
                    make disks rotate. The fuel efficiency of his engine was as high as 90%, a big achievement considering this is
                    similar to the efficiency of some modern turbines.</p>
                </li>

                <li><p><strong id="li-title">The Shadowgraph</strong> - While Rontgen has been credited with developing the first X-ray
                    films, called shadowgraphs, there is clear evidence that Tesla was also working in this area. The problem is that
                    Tesla lost a lot of his work due to a fire in his lab. Tesla may well have produced the first x-ray image in the
                    United States when he attempted to use a vacuum tube to obtain an image of Mark Twain. However, instead of Twain,
                    the resulting image showed the screw for adjusting the camera lens. He did later obtain shadowgraph images of the
                    human body, shortly after Roentgen published his discovery on November 8, 1895. Tesla also described some clinical
                    benefits of x-rays.</p>
                </li>

                <li><p><strong id="li-title">The Radio</strong> - Before his lab burned down, Tesla discovered that he could use his
                    coils to transmit and receive powerful radio signals, tuning them to resonate at the same frequency. By early 1895,
                    he was ready to transmit a signal 50 miles from his lab, to West Point, New York. But the fire in Tesla's lab
                    destroyed his work. While he was rebuilding, a young Italian experimenter named Guglielmo Marconi, who was working
                    in England, took out the first wireless telegraphy patent. When Marconi later set up long-distance demonstrations,
                    he used a Tesla oscillator to transmit the signals across the English Channel.</p>
                </li>

                <li><p><strong id="li-title">The Neon Lamp</strong> - Tesla did not invent fluorescent or neon lights, but he did
                    contribute to improving both inventions. He took the lights and created the first neon sign. At the 1893 Chicago
                    World’s Fair, he demonstrated neon light signs and how they can make unique designs and even form words. Thanks
                    to Tesla you can identify your favorite bar.</p>
                </li>

                <li><p><strong id="li-title">The Niagara Falls Transformer House</strong> - When it came to deciding what company would
                    build a power generator at Niagara Falls, Thomas Edison was the first choice. After reviewing Tesla’s work for
                    Westinghouse Electric, though, the Niagara Falls commission went with Tesla’s alternating current power. Despite
                    doubts, Tesla’s system worked well and became a standard for hydroelectric power</p>
                </li>

                <li><p><strong id="li-title">The Induction Motor</strong> - The first AC commutator-free three-phase induction motor
                    was invented independently by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla. Although Ferraris presented his engine first, in
                    1885, it was Tesla who filed for a patent first. George Westinghouse, who was developing an alternating current
                    power system at that time, licensed Tesla's patents in 1888. This type of motor is commonly used in vacuums,
                    blow dryers, and power tools, even today.</p>
                </li>

                <li><p><strong id="li-title">The Radio Controlled Boat</strong> - The Teleautomaton was the first radio-controlled
                    boat that was designed by Tesla. After being denied a patent because the patent office didn’t think it was feasible,
                    he proved them wrong by demonstrating the boat at the Electrical Exhibition in 1898.</p>
                </li>

                <li><p><strong id="li-title">Alternating Current</strong> - Alternating current is considered Tesla’s crowning
                    achievement. While not the inventor of AC power, he made it easy to use widespread. AC power allows for electricity
                    to be sent over long distances much more efficiently. Westinghouse bought Tesla’s AC patents and used them to bid on
                     the lighting of the Chicago World’s Fair. They won the contract and were able to provide power at around $150,000,
                     which is less than it would have cost to provide power using direct current.</p>
